# free-your-silvercrest
Project for freeing the Lidl Silvercrest Smart Home Gateway from the cloud. This hardware is actually a rebranded Tuya TYGWZ01 Zigbee to Ethernet bridge.

A collection of scripts/programs for hacking Lidl Silvercrest and Tuya TYGWZ-01 smart home gateways/bridges so no longer dependent on any cloud services.

This hacks allows you to remotly connect to these Zigbee to Ethernet gateways/bridges from home automation applications (e.g. Home Assistant's ZHA integration or Zigbee2MQTT), in the same way as [tasmota-zbbridge](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/Sonoff_ZBBridge.html), [esphome-zbbridge](https://github.com/thegroove/esphome-zbbridge/), and [Tube's Zigbee Gateways](https://github.com/tube0013/tube_gateways), as long as both the gateway and your home automation application is connected to you local network.
